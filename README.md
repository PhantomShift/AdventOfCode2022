# Advent of Code 2022: A Rusty Attempt
A rusty, in multiple senses, attempt at the Advent of Code puzzles for Christmas of 2022.

Similar to 2021, this is largely a practice/exploration of a new language for me, the language being Rust this time around.

Each day is run/built individually by cargo by specifing with the `--bin` argument, e.g. `cargo run --bin day1`\
Individual tests can be run via `cargo test day_d_part_p`, with `d` and `p` being the relevant day and part, or all tests of a given day i.e. `cargo test --bin day1`

All solutions are written and compiled for rust version 1.69.0 ðŸ‘Œ
